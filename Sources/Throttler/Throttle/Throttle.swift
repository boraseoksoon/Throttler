/**
 Limits the rate at which a closure is executed by delaying its execution until a specified amount of time has passed since the last execution.

 - Parameters:
    - interval: The minimum amount of time that must pass before the closure can be executed again. Default value is 1 sec.
    - actorType: The actor type to use for executing the closure. Default value is `.main`.
    - operation: The closure to execute.

 - Note: If the device is running iOS 16.0 or later, the closure will be executed on the main actor by default. If the device is running a version of iOS prior to 16.0, the closure will be executed on a background thread.

 - Important: If a new execution is requested before the interval has elapsed since the last execution, the previous execution will be cancelled and the closure will not be executed.

 - Example: This example throttles the execution of a closure, printing a message to the console each time the closure is executed, but ensuring that no more than one message is printed per 50 milliseconds:

 (0...100000).forEach { i in
     throttle(.seconds(0.01)) {
         print(i)
     }
 }
 
 //  0
 //  18133
 //  36058
 //  57501
 //  82851

/**
 Limits the rate at which a closure is executed by delaying its execution until a specified amount of time has passed since the last execution.

 - Parameters:
    - seconds: The minimum amount of time in seconds that must pass before the closure can be executed again. Default value is 1 seconds.
    - actorType: The actor type to use for executing the closure. Default value is `.main`.
    - operation: The closure to execute.

 - Precondition: `seconds` must be greater than or equal to zero.

 - Important: If a new execution is requested before the interval has elapsed since the last execution, the previous execution will be cancelled and the closure will not be executed.

 - Example: This example throttles the execution of a closure, printing a message to the console each time the closure is executed, but ensuring that no more than one message is printed per 0.1 seconds:

 (0...100000).forEach { i in
     throttle(seconds: 0.01) {
         print(i)
