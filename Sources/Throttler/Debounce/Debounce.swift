/**
 Delays the execution of a closure until a specified amount of time has passed since the last time the closure was executed.

 - Parameters:
    - interval: The minimum amount of time that must pass before the closure can be executed again. Default value is 1 sec.
    - actorType: The actor type to use for executing the closure. Default value is `.main`.
    - operation: The closure to execute.

 - Note: If the device is running iOS 16.0 or later, the closure will be executed on the main actor by default. If the device is running a version of iOS prior to 16.0, the closure will be executed on a background thread.

 - Important: If a new execution is requested before the interval has elapsed since the last execution, the previous execution will be cancelled and the closure will not be executed.

 - Example: This example debounces the execution of a closure, printing a message to the console each time the closure is executed, but ensuring that no more than one message is printed per 100 milliseconds:

 debounce {
     print("fired after 1 sec")
 }
 
 debounce(.seconds(2)) {
    print("fired after 2 seconds")
 }

/**
 Delays the execution of a closure until a specified amount of time has passed since the last time the closure was executed.

 - Parameters:
    - seconds: The minimum amount of time in seconds that must pass before the closure can be executed again. Default value is 1.0 seconds.
    - actorType: The actor type to use for executing the closure. Default value is `.main`.
    - operation: The closure to execute.

 - Precondition: `seconds` must be greater than or equal to zero.

 - Important: If a new execution is requested before the interval has elapsed since the last execution, the previous execution will be cancelled and the closure will not be executed.

 - Example: This example debounces the execution of a closure, printing a message to the console each time the closure is executed, but ensuring that no more than one message is printed per 0.1 seconds:

 debounce(seconds: 2.0, on: .main) {
     print("fired after 2 seconds")
 }
