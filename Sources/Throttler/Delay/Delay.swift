/**
 Delays the execution of a closure by a specified interval.

 - Parameters:
    - interval: The time interval to delay execution by. Default value is 1 second.
    - actorType: The actor type to use for executing the closure. Default value is `.main`.
    - operation: The closure to execute after the delay.

 - Precondition: `interval` must be greater than or equal to zero.

 - Note: If the device is running iOS 16.0 or later, the closure will be executed on the main actor by default. If the device is running a version of iOS prior to 16.0, the closure will be executed on a background thread.

 - Important: If a new delay is requested before a previous delay has completed, the previous delay will be cancelled and the closure will not be executed.

 - Example: This example delays the execution of a closure by 1 second:

        delay {
            print("fired after 1 second.")
        }

    This example delays the execution of a closure by 2 seconds and executes it on a current actor:

        delay(.seconds(2), on: .current) {
            print("fired after 2 seconds.")
        }

/**
 Delays the execution of a closure by a specified number of seconds.

 - Parameters:
    - seconds: The number of seconds to delay execution by.
    - actorType: The actor type to use for executing the closure. Default value is `.main`.
    - operation: The closure to execute after the delay.

 - Precondition: `seconds` must be greater than or equal to zero.

 - Important: If a new delay is requested before a previous delay has completed, the previous delay will be cancelled and the closure will not be executed.

 - Example: This example delays the execution of a closure by 2 seconds:

        delay(seconds: 2) {
            print("fired after 2 seconds.")
        }
